# Product Microservice - Feature Document

## 📋 **Service Overview**

The Product Microservice is a core business service responsible for managing the complete product catalog in the ecommerce platform. It serves as the single source of truth for all product-related information and provides APIs for product discovery, management, and inventory tracking.

## 🎯 **Business Domain Definition**

### **What is a Product?**

A **Product** in our ecommerce context represents a sellable item with the following characteristics:

- **Physical or Digital**: Can be tangible goods (books, electronics) or digital items (software, subscriptions)
- **Sellable Entity**: Has pricing information and can be purchased
- **Categorized**: Belongs to one or more categories for organization
- **Searchable**: Contains metadata for discovery and filtering
- **Inventory Tracked**: Has stock levels and availability status
- **Multi-variant**: Can have variations (size, color, model) as separate SKUs

### **Product Hierarchy**
```
Category → Product → Variant (SKU)
```

**Example:**
- Category: "Electronics > Smartphones"
- Product: "iPhone 15"
- Variants: "iPhone 15 128GB Black", "iPhone 15 256GB Blue"
